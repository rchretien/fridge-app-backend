Generic single-database configuration.

Create a .env-dev with

```
ENVIRONMENT = dev
DB_TYPE = postgres
API_NAME = Fridge Inventory App Backend
DB_USER = postgres
DB_password = *****
DB_NAME = fridge_inventory_dev
DB_HOST = localhost
DB_PORT = 5432
POSTGRES_USER = postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD =  *****
POSTGRES_DB = fridge_inventory_dev
```

```
docker compose --env-file .env-dev --profile postgres up -d postgres
```
Make sure we don't have an existing posgres server running locally.
For example on Mac

```
brew services stop postgresql
```

Verify you can connect to the postgres database
```
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d fridge_inventory_dev
```
Test that alembic can connect to the database
```
uv run alembic current
```
Create initial migration
```
ENVIRONMENT=dev uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial schema"
```

Inspect the migration file in versions folder.

Apply the migration
```
ENVIRONMENT=dev uv run alembic upgrade head
```

You should see:
```
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl PostgresqlImpl.
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume transactional DDL.
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade  -> ea84b5ce47e9, Initial schema


Verify the schema is correct
```
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d fridge_inventory_dev
```

```
\dt
              List of relations
 Schema |       Name       | Type  |  Owner
--------+------------------+-------+----------
 public | alembic_version  | table | postgres
 public | product          | table | postgres
 public | product_location | table | postgres
 public | product_type     | table | postgres
(4 rows)
```

Create a migration for seed data
```
ENVIRONMENT=dev uv run alembic revision -m "Add seed data for product types and locations"
```

ENVIRONMENT=dev uv run alembic upgrade head
