# Fridge App Backend

A backend REST API that supports a fridge inventory UI

## Using

To serve this app, run:

```sh
docker compose up app
```

and open [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

Within the Dev Container this is equivalent to:

```sh
poe api
```

## 💾 Development Setup with PostgreSQL

This section explains how to set up a local development environment using Docker, PostgreSQL, and Alembic migrations for the Fridge Inventory App Backend.

---

### 1. Create a `.env-dev` file

Create a file named `.env-dev` in the project root:

```env
# Environment
ENVIRONMENT=dev
DB_TYPE=postgres
API_NAME=Fridge Inventory App Backend

# Application DB config
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=fridge_inventory_dev
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432

# PostgreSQL container init variables
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword
POSTGRES_DB=fridge_inventory_dev
```
### 2. Start the PostgreSQL container

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env-dev --profile postgres up -d postgres
```
Verify the container is running:

```bash
docker ps
```

### 3. Verify the database connection

From your host machine:
```
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d fridge_inventory_dev
```
### 4. Start the FastAPI app
```
ENVIRONMENT=dev uv run uvicorn fridge_app_backend.api.app:app --reload

```
The API will connect to the PostgreSQL database using the .env-dev configuration. Alembic will run the migration at api start up.

### 5. Stop the database when finished
```
docker compose --profile postgres down`
```

<summary>Prerequisites</summary>

<details>
<summary>1. Set up Git to use SSH</summary>

1. [Generate an SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key) and [add the SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).
1. Configure SSH to automatically load your SSH keys:
    ```sh
    cat << EOF >> ~/.ssh/config
    
    Host *
      AddKeysToAgent yes
      IgnoreUnknown UseKeychain
      UseKeychain yes
      ForwardAgent yes
    EOF
    ```

<summary>2. Install Docker</summary>

1. [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
    - _Linux only_:
        - Export your user's user id and group id so that [files created in the Dev Container are owned by your user](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/3206):
            ```sh
            cat << EOF >> ~/.bashrc
            
            export UID=$(id --user)
            export GID=$(id --group)
            EOF
            ```

</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Install VS Code or PyCharm</summary>

1. [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [VS Code's Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers). Alternatively, install [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).
2. _Optional:_ install a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) such as [FiraCode Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode) and [configure VS Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/VS-Code-Instructions) or [configure PyCharm](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/Intellij-products-instructions) to use it.
